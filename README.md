## Search Products Application

This is a simple implementation of a Scrum Board, a tool that helps visualize and manage work. Originally it was first created in Toyota automotive, but nowadays it's widely used in software development.

A Scrum Board is usually made of 3 columns - *TODO*, *InProgres*s & *Done*. In each column there are Post-it notes that represents task and their status.

As already stated this project is an implementation of such board and made of 3 separate Docker containers that holds:

- MongoBD provided by Walmart
- Java backend (Spring Boot)
- Angular frontend

The entry point for a user is a website which is available under the
address: **http://localhost:4200/**

- Host: *localhost*
- Database: *scrum*
- User: *scrum*
- Password: *scrum*


Like other parts of application Postgres database is containerized and
the definition of its Docker container can be found in
*docker-compose.yml* file.

```yml
scrum-postgres:
    image: "postgres:9.6-alpine"
    container_name: scrum-postgres
    volumes:
      - scrum-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB:scrum
      - POSTGRES_USER:scrum
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD:scrum
```

#### scrum-app (REST API)

This app is also put in Docker container and its definition can be found
in a file *scrum-app/Dockerfile*. 



#### search-engine-front (Frontend)

This is a real endpoint for a user where they can manipulate their
scrums and tasks. It consumes the REST API endpoints provided by
*scrum-app*.

It can be entered using link: **http://localhost:4200/**
